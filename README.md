# R-Data-frame-01
This is a data frame I have experimented on cleaning up.

Here is the scenario:

You are working on a research project where you are examining test scores from around the country. Different teachers have sent in their data and they are now located in Percentages.csv. The data comes from a test that is worth 120 points. The teachers were instructed to send in the test scores as percentages. As the team data scientists, you and your partner have the job of cleaning up the data before it is used in the study. Prepare a document to share with your team at the next meeting, describing what you did to clean the data. Make sure you include reproducible code, because you might need to make changes later!
